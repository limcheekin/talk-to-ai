The project is inspired by [Talk To Claude](https://huggingface.co/spaces/fastrtc/talk-to-claude).

It is powered by [FastRTC](https://fastrtc.org/). FastRTC is a Python library by Hugging Face that transforms any Python function into a real-time audio or video stream via WebRTC or WebSocketsâ€”complete with a sleek built-in Gradio UI, free telephone support, and seamless FastAPI integration to let you build production-ready communication.
